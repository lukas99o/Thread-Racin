# Thread Racing Simulation

## Overview

Welcome to the Thread Racing Simulation! This C# program simulates a thrilling car race where each car is represented by a separate thread. Each car has its own top speed, and as they race, they finish at different times based on their speeds. The program tracks the progress of each car and displays the results on a scoreboard when all cars have crossed the finish line. This project is a fun way to explore asynchronous programming and threading in C#.

## Features

- **Multithreaded Racing:** Each car runs on its own thread, simulating a real-time race.
- **Variable Speeds:** Cars have different top speeds, affecting their finish times.
- **Scoreboard:** Displays the final positions of each car once the race is complete.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Demonstrates the use of async programming concepts in C#.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (Core or Framework)
- A C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Thread-Racing-Simulation.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Thread-Racin

3. **Open the Project:**
   Open the project file (`.csporj) in your preferred C# development enviroment.

## Usage
1. **Run the Program:**
   Start the program to begin the thread race!
2. **Observe the Race**
   The console will display the winner!
